# The Progression of the Vending Machine

The progression of the Vending Machine Assignments.. Includes 4 Vending Machine Assignments.. Without getting to indepth
it started as a console app, progressed into a javascript webapp and culminated into a full blown Spring MVC Web Application

3. Console App with ... This application must follow the MVC pattern used for all previous labs (App class, Controller, View, Service Layer, DAO) â€“ this includes the use of constructor based dependency injection.

4. Similar to "3" ... A console app using Spring dependency injection and ulitilizing Aspect Oriented Programming to log exceptions
onto an audit file. 

6. RESTful Vending Machine : The purpose of this lab is to show your proficiency in using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to create a browser-based user interface for an existing web service. You will show your ability to use these skills by building a page that allows a user to interact with a virtual Vending Machine via the supplied Vending Machine REST API

7. Similar to "6" ... instead of implementing RESTful API calls we are to implement a in memory DAO ... this would later be useful 
for other projects as a reference for when we implement MySQL and databases.
